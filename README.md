# Random Machines
Adds a handful of machines to Minecraft. Recipes for these machines can be added via JSON files.

This is a mod to add a handful of machines to Minecraft. Currently, it adds just the one - the jar - but more will likely be added as I find the need or desire to make them.

It adds a `recipes` folder under the `config` folder, with its own `randommachines` folder. Any `JSON` files in the `randommachines` folder will be interpreted as recipe files.
